# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview

Our study' goal is to provide a summary dataframe that displays ride sharing data by city type (Rural,Urban & Suburban). Once we have our data, we will make a multiple line graph that shows total weekly fares by city type. We started by utilizing the pandas Groupby() function with the count() and sum () functions to retrieve the total number of drivers, rides, and fares by city type. We were able to calculate our average fare per ride and driver after pulling this information and assigning it to functions. We were able to format into a new data frame and re-format the columns once we had all of that information collected. In the second section of this exercise, we will

## Results

I produced a statistics overview and summary using PyBers ride sharing data analysis and aggregation.

Rural communities have the fewest drivers, rides, and overall fares. The most drivers, rides, and total fares are found in urban areas.Suburban cities rank second in terms of drivers, rides, and overall fares. Despite having the fewest drivers, rides, and fares, rural cities have the highest average fare per ride and fare per driver. Despite having the most drivers, rides, and fares, urban cities have the lowest average fare per ride and fare per driver.

## Summary

Based on our data, we can predict what types of fares will be demanded based on the city type of the passenger. Although we did not visit every city, we have a good idea of what fares would look like from week to week based on city type, which is enough information to determine the rates that will need to be charged once we know what type of city the customer lives in. Because of the supply and demand in the area, rural locations may have a higher charge rate. The fact that there are fewer drivers per ride makes it more expensive.

1. Assign your drivers to different city categories based on the cities in which they regularly work.
2. Chargeing more in rural areas due to the frequency at which they are used locally
3. Opportunities for company expansion in rural and suburban areas, including hiring drivers
